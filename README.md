# Finder

I wrote this while following Brad Traversy's "React Front to Back" course.

A web application for searching and browsing Github repositories

Technologies used: React, Javascript, HTML, CSS

## Installation
```sh
npm install
```
In order to use the Github API you need to supply your own credentials.  
You can do this by creating a .env.local file in the project's root directory and adding the following code:

```
REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID='your client id'  
REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET='your client secret'
```

## Usage
```sh
npm start
```
This runs the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in a browser.
